       The project at hand is to design a website for the Center for Socially Relevant Computing (CSRC). Its current website is lacking and not user friendly. It would be ideal to redesign a more appropriate website which serves the purpose of the cause and is simplistic.  This website should clearly reflect who and what the CSRC is and its mission. A page of the website should be designated to express what works the CSRC has done and its commitment.  Another page could collectively gather ideas and projects for the future. Here, current active members and those interested may collaborate many more good works. This page may also detail on how one may participate or get involved in the project. Another page could be made specifically for investors and partners. On this page the driving pitch on why investors should invest in the CSRC and what steps can be taken to donate or become a sponsor. These are just a few ideas on present a clear and well organized website for the CSRC. Our objective is to design and bring these ideas to reality in a functional website for the CSRC.

       </p>
       <p>
        Demographics for our website would consist, but not limited to, teachers and students and members of the community around who look to take part and connect in the project at hand. These would be ideal users given the work and learning environment that surrounds them and we would like the CSRCâ€™s webpage to meet those standards.  Improvements would lie in the simplicity and ease of use of the website. A clean, organize and appealing redesign would encourage involvement in the program and attract investors.
       </p>
       <p>
        The construction of the CSRC website would be useful in the sense uniting students, teachers, universities and several communities close together and serving as a resourceful tool to display the program. Quality of life of the users would consist of convenience and organization. 
       </p>
       <p>
        The main requirements would be creating a simple and fresh-designed for the CSRC website. Creating several webpages and tabs would be required and illustration of what the CSRC   represents should be designed and displayed.  Ideally the website should be flexible and universal for users to use. Should be simple and ease to you and navigate. The user interface should be straightforward and easy to use. Yet, would show a modern and fresh design. The project of designing the website and running it should be highly affordable and profitable in its cause. Investors, partners and sponsors would cover costs and more.  No hardware or devices necessary. The website should be an open platform to many browsers and in future updates a mobile or app friendly version would be considered. Any technicalities of the project expected would be coding and the design of each webpage within the website. Keeping to the set goals, ideal design, and setting up an initial presentation for investors may come up as a technicality.
