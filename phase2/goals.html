       <p><b><i>Goals</i></b><br/></p>
       <p>
        <ol><li><b>Network/Involvement</b><br/>Our goal for SRC is to connect with people and organizations across the country who share the same interest to develop technology that could benefit people and communities. This technology can be developed through research and growth in the field of computer science and engineering. It is often misconceived that such a field of study is socially irrelevant. Often thought to consist of projects solely such as data mining or creating databases. Actually itâ€™s highly relevant. The possibilities through computer science and engineering are endless. One would only have to look at the world around us and see the real world problems we face every day. Creating solutions through new innovations for real world problems is socially relevant as the things we create hold a great impact how people live. Through a unified and well-presented website for the SRC, we would like to encourage computer developers, engineers, and students studying in such majors to get involved. Technological development does not have to be restricted to corporate and industrialized companies for marketing and sales. Using skills, creativity and the will to make a difference can a person improve the quality of life or even change the way people do certain things. Technology has always in history be used to assist ourselves to carry out tasks. Some of these tasks challenge our own limits in respect to either time or physical restraints. There are many ideas or individuals with great imaginations whom can provide solutions to these challenges. The SRC would like to get students, teachers, and many organizations involved to developing real life solution to real life problems. The website would ideally act as grounds where everyone can come together to find projects, collaborate ideas and create actual solutions. The web page should provide resources such as what projects to get involved in, posting projects, contact information page to directly get more immediate information and a web page for those who wish to invest/donate to further develop SRC and the projects it is involved in.</li><br/><li><b>Simplicity in Recreated Website</b><br/>It is a goal for us to replace the current SRC website with one more simplistic and attractive in navigation. Navigation should be smooth and easy between pages. Web pages that ideally should be included are a home page, a mission statement page, contact, developers, Investors and Client page, and a testimonial page. Upon visiting the home page, visitors should right away get a sense of what SRC is and how has its how impact affected people of the community. A few pictures along with a brief description on the home page should reflect this. Links from this page should be set for other webpages. The mission statement page should in detail express who SRC is, what projects it has done so far (history) and what it hopes to accomplish. References and awards from outside sources can be provided on this pages with links. The developers, investors and client pages would differ depending on who is visiting on the site and would include description on current projects and how to get involved or how to post a project. The testimonial page would be essential as it shows in vivid detail the success of past projects, the testimony of organizations and clients who received help (pictures and short videos are expected to be here), and also shows current investors in the SRC who have made it possible for these projects to be funded. Overall the appearance should offer a sense of professionalism, simplicity, and attraction for visitors to be encouraged to get involved with SRC and its works. The main goal is create a unique and unified page for SRC and replace its many lacking website versions.</li></ol>
