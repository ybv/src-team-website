       <p>A lot of people can have benefits of using Social Relevant Computing from students, teachers, and people with disabilities or handicapped. There are certain examples where SRC has helped people resolving their issues in real life. Some examples have been discussed here.</p>

<p>David is in a wheelchair and has limited upper body mobility. A menu-driven software of selecting phrases and words was developed using commercial grade technology to help David to communicate. Later, this project was carried forward to assemble the whole system in a single system with some additional features. Now, David continues to use it as a main means of communication.</p>

<p>An augmentative communication device with graphics and auditory feedback was developed for children. Devices for children were expected to have a user-interface appropriate for non-readers, including menu items that address a child’s home, school, and medical settings. The Centre for Handicapped Children’s Learning Centre (CHC) kindly offered to serve as a specification and testing facility, including the use of its client base, faculty, therapists, nursing staff, administration, and equipment. The children at the Centre are medically frail and technology-dependent.</p>

<p>A DISCO System, to enhance choice making and cause-and-effect in physical, speech, and occupational therapy sessions with physically and developmentally impaired children, developed utilizing light, music, and sound. This station would help therapists and teachers create a choice-making, positive feedback or a calming environment for students who react positively to enhanced sensory experiences. The clients and customers are teachers and therapists. The users are handicapped students.</p>

<p>A software developed on hurricane risk assessment and the design of evacuation policies for the city of Houston. The area is home over to 5.5 million inhabitants. When hurricane Rita bore down on Houston, 2.5 million residents were evacuated. The first sub-task is to mine the database to assess the household-level flood and wind damage risk and to identify regions of the city that are particularly vulnerable. Moreover, it is to build computational tools that tag the properties and display them using state-of-the-art. GIS mapping tools. Second sub-task is to use the calculated information on safety the properties to estimate the number of people who need to evacuate and their geographic distribution.</p>

<p>The examples provided above gives us the idea of how the software can be used by different people in order to resolve the real world problems. SRC emphasizes the use of computation for solving problems of personal and societal interest. It offers opportunities to demonstrate that computer science is a mainstream endeavour and that it offers conceptual and technological tools for solving meaningful, real world problems.
